How It Works—Feature by Feature
Compliance Dashboard


Your new morning ritual: one glance tells you if your dental, medical, or home-care operation is green, amber, or red on every HIPAA requirement—no digging, no guesswork.


Automated Task Management


Auto-assign annual trainings, policy reviews, and risk reassessments to dentists, physicians, developers, counselors, or caregivers—then sit back as the system nudges your team and tracks completions.


Employee & Provider Management


Add or import profiles for your front-desk staff, physicians, nurses, developers, therapists, or home aides—track training progress and compliance status at a glance.


Bite-Size, Role-Specific Training


10-minute modules tailored to dental assistants, physicians, engineers, mental health counselors, and home care providers—complete with quizzes and instant certificates.


Guided Risk Assessment Tool


Step-by-step SRA flags vulnerabilities in your clinical workflows, telehealth platform, or in-home processes—export prioritized remediation plans in minutes.


Real-Time Notifications & Reports


Get pinged when a hygienist, nurse, coder, therapist, or caregiver finishes—or misses—a module. Pull completion, usage, or past-due reports in one click.


Centralized Document Library


One source of truth for policies, BAAs, breach-plans, and updates—version control included so your practice manager, CTO, or clinical director never worries about outdated docs.
